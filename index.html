    <h1>My Journey into Tech</h1>
    <h2>From Curiosity to Coding</h2>
    <p>Meet Andrea, a young woman who recently decided to embark <br> on a new and exciting journey into the world of <B>technology</B> <br> and <B>coding.</B> She had always been curious about  how websites <br> and applications worked, but never imagined she would start <br> learning how to to build them herself.
        <h3>The First steps</h3>
        <p>Andrea began by learning the basics of HTML, the foundation <br> of web development. She created her first webpage, adding <br> headings, paragraphs, and even formatting her text using <br> <B>boldd,</B> <i>italic,</i> and <u>underline</u> elements </p>
        <p>Every new tag she learned brought a sense of <br> accomplishment. <br> She quickly became comfortable with HTML elements and is <br>  eager to explore more. <br> Next on her list: learning more HTML elements and CSS to <br> style her web pages!

                <p>At the end of this program, Andrea can build web pages and <br> will slowly venture into <i>javaScript</i> to make her projects <br> interactive.</p>
            </p>
            <h4>The Road Ahead</h4>
            <p>Andrea knows that the road to mastering tech is long, but she is <br> excited for the future. She's even started sharing her progress <br> on social media to others, especially other women, to <br> dive into the world of coding. </p>
                 <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                 <p>Andrea's journey is just beginning. With passion, <br> determination, and the ability to <u>never stop learning,</u> she <br> knows that the possibilities in tech are endless.</p>
